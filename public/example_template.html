<h1>SNP Report Template DRAFT</h1>

<div class="warning">PRELIMINARY VERSION -- HOMOZYGOUS and HETEROZYGOUS ARE WRONG!!!</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your genes are the blueprint you were born with, but they are not your destiny. While genetic variations (SNPs) can predispose you to certain tendencies, how these genes are expressed depends largely on epigenetics—the interaction of diet, lifestyle, stress, toxins, and environment. This report highlights your potential areas of strength and vulnerability, with suggestions for labs, diet, lifestyle, and protective actions that can help you optimize health and prevent disease expression.</p>

<h2>Legend for Genetic Findings</h2>
<p>• <span class="red-bold">+/+ (red bold):</span> Homozygous variant. Both copies of the gene carry this change. Strongest impact, higher priority for diet & lifestyle support.</p>
<p>• +/– (black): Heterozygous variant. One copy of the gene carries this change. Moderate effect, usually balanced with the right habits.</p>
<p>• –/– (not shown): Typical version. No variant of concern here.</p>

<h2>Your Genetic Insights Report</h2>

<h3>Food and Nutrients</h3>
<p>Genes can influence how well you absorb and activate essential vitamins and minerals like folate, B12, vitamin D, magnesium, and selenium. Weaknesses here can drive fatigue, bone loss, or immune issues. By choosing the right foods and nutrient forms, you can bypass your genetic bottlenecks and thrive.</p>

<p class="bold">SNPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) [Homozygous +/+]</span><br>
 This SNP reduces the activity of the MTHFR enzyme by up to 70%, which slows the conversion of folate into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (active folate). Reduced methylfolate can increase homocysteine levels, affecting cardiovascular health, neurotransmitter synthesis, and DNA methylation.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> Serum homocysteine, methylfolate, riboflavin levels<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> Supplement with methylated folate (5-MTHF), riboflavin, and methyl-B12; ensure dietary folate intake; monitor homocysteine.</li>

<li><span class="bold">VDR (rs2228570, rs1544410) [Heterozygous +/–]</span><br>
 Variants in the vitamin D receptor gene may reduce receptor function, limiting vitamin D signaling in bone, immune, and metabolic pathways. Even with normal 25(OH)D levels, cellular signaling may be impaired.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> Serum vitamin D, calcium, immune markers<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> Optimize vitamin D intake; consider D3 supplementation; monitor calcium levels.</li>

<li><span class="bold">BCMO1 (rs7501331) [Heterozygous +/–]</span><br>
 BCMO1 converts beta-carotene to active vitamin A. Variants reduce efficiency, increasing reliance on preformed vitamin A for vision, immunity, and epithelial health.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> Retinol, carotenoid levels<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> Include carotenoid-rich foods; consider preformed vitamin A supplementation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Summary Placeholder:</p>
<p>Nutrient SNPs don't doom you to deficiency — they spotlight what your body needs most. By upgrading diet and supplements, you can create vibrant energy and resilience.</p>

<h3>Detoxification & Biotransformation</h3>
<p>Your body works around the clock to clear toxins, hormones, and environmental chemicals. Genes in detox pathways affect how quickly or efficiently you process these compounds. Understanding these variants allows targeted nutritional and lifestyle interventions to optimize detoxification.</p>

<p class="bold">SNPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">COMT V158M (rs4680) [Heterozygous +/–]</span><br>
 Catechol-O-methyltransferase metabolizes catecholamines and catechol estrogens. Variants reduce activity, increasing oxidative stress and hormone metabolite accumulation. This can exacerbate anxiety, estrogen dominance, and toxin sensitivity.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> Catecholamine and estrogen metabolite panels<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> Magnesium, methyl donors, and antioxidant support.</li>

<li><span class="bold">GSTM1 (deletion) [Heterozygous +/–]</span><br>
 Glutathione-S-transferase deletion reduces phase II detoxification capacity, limiting removal of xenobiotics and oxidative compounds.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> Glutathione status<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> NAC, glycine, selenium supplementation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Summary Placeholder:</p>
<p>Detox SNPs aren't destiny — they're guidance. By supporting clearance daily, you can stay clean, energized, and resilient.</p>

<h3>Mental Health, Neurotransmitters & Stress Resilience</h3>
<p>Neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and GABA determine whether you feel motivated, balanced, and emotionally steady — or scattered, moody, and reactive. Genetic tendencies may influence how quickly you make or clear these brain chemicals.</p>

<p class="bold">SNPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) [Heterozygous +/–]</span><br>
 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports the growth and survival of neurons. Variants can impair neurogenesis, reduce brain plasticity, and contribute to mood disorders like depression and anxiety.<br>
 <span class="bold">Follow-up Labs:</span> BDNF levels, mood symptom tracking<br>
 <span class="bold">Recommended Actions:</span> Support BDNF levels with physical exercise, omega-3s, and intermittent fasting. Manage stress levels through relaxation techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Summary Placeholder:</p>
<p>Mental health SNPs provide insights into neurotransmitter imbalances and stress response. These SNPs guide personalized nutrition, lifestyle interventions, and therapeutic strategies to support emotional resilience and mental wellness.</p>
