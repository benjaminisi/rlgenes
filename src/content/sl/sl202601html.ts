<p class="heading">GSS (Glutathione Synthetase)</p>

<p class="heading">GSS rs121909307 (C &gt; T)</p>

<p>
Glutathione synthetase catalyzes the final ATP-dependent step of glutathione synthesis, determining total glutathione pool size and reserve capacity. In this curriculum, GSS is a functional bottleneck without a consumer-test SNP, because common platforms do not include a consistently interpretable regulatory variant.
</p>

<p>
Physiologically, reduced GSS activity presents as a low-reserve phenotype. Baseline glutathione values may appear normal, but during oxidative stress, inflammation, infection, or detoxification, glutathione stores deplete quickly and recover slowly. This results in elevated lipid peroxidation, oxidative biomarkers, and increased vulnerability to stress.
</p>

<p>
Because GSS limits synthesis rather than recycling, supplying precursors alone does not reliably expand glutathione reserves when enzyme capacity is capped. Clinical emphasis is placed on reducing oxidative demand, pacing stressors, and preserving reserve rather than pushing detox output.
</p>

<p class="heading">GSR (Glutathione Reductase)</p>

<p class="heading">GSR rs2978663 (A &gt; G)</p>

<p>
Reduced glutathione recycling efficiency under oxidative stress
</p>

<p>
This SNP is associated with reduced efficiency of glutathione reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back into its reduced, active form (GSH). The G allele limits recycling capacity, particularly when oxidative demand rises.
</p>

<p>
Physiologically this creates a slow redox recovery phenotype. Glutathione is present but remains oxidized longer after exertion, illness, inflammation, or toxin exposure. This leads to a low GSH:GSSG ratio, elevated oxidative markers, and prolonged inflammatory signalling.
</p>

<p>
Clinically, individuals may experience delayed recovery after exercise or illness, exaggerated responses to detoxification or antimicrobial protocols, and heightened sensitivity to oxidative stressors. Baseline labs may look acceptable, but stress exposes the bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
Key nutrient cofactors include riboflavin (FAD), NADPH-supportive nutrients (niacin, magnesium), selenium and glutathione precursors. Lifestyle strategies focus on reducing oxidative load rather than forcing antioxidant output.
</p>

<p class="heading">GSR rs1002149 (A &gt; G)</p>

<p>
Lower baseline glutathione recycling capacity
</p>

<p>
This regulatory SNP is associated with reduced baseline activity or expression of glutathione reductase. The G allele lowers resting recycling capacity, increasing oxidative tone even in the absence of acute stress.
</p>

<p>
Physiologically this results in higher baseline oxidative stress, increased glutathione turnover, and reduced buffering margin. Cells operate closer to their redox threshold, leaving less flexibility during metabolic or inflammatory challenges.
</p>

<p>
Clinically this pattern may present as chronic fatigue, chemical sensitivity, increased oxidative biomarkers at rest, and slower recovery from minor stressors. This SNP compounds other mitochondrial or oxidative vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Relevant cofactors include riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, selenium and glutathione precursors. Lifestyle supports include minimizing chronic inflammatory inputs, stabilizing blood sugar and supporting mitochondrial efficiency.
</p>

<p class="heading">GLUL (Glutamine Synthetase)</p>

<p class="heading">GLUL rs10911021 (T &gt; C)</p>

<p>
Reduced glutamine synthesis and nitrogen buffering capacity
</p>

<p>
This SNP is associated with reduced expression or efficiency of glutamine synthetase, the enzyme responsible for converting glutamate and ammonia into glutamine. The C risk allele lowers glutamine availability and weakens ammonia buffering capacity.
</p>

<p>
Physiologically this increases vulnerability to nitrogen stress, particularly during high protein intake, illness, inflammation, constipation, dysbiosis, or catabolic states. Reduced glutamine availability also limits downstream glutathione synthesis and epithelial and immune resilience.
</p>

<p>
Clinically this pattern may present as brain fog, irritability, nausea, fatigue during illness or exertion, and poor tolerance of ammonia-producing gut patterns. Oxidative stress rises secondarily because glutamine availability constrains glutathione production.
</p>

<p>
Key supports include managing gut-derived ammonia, supporting liver and mitochondrial nitrogen handling, maintaining adequate glutamine availability, and reducing inflammatory and nitrosative stress. Lifestyle strategies focus on transit time, fiber tolerance, pacing protein intake, and minimizing catabolic load.
